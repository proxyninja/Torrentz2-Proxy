# About Torrentz

After many torrent sites were launched around the world, it was necessary to introduce a search engine to crawl all available torrent files. As with everything else on the internet, not all torrent trackers have content that is right for you, and browsing through all of that data can take some time. This is why Torrentz was released to index all torrent files available online. Often referred to as the Google of Torrent Search, Torrent will list the most suitable results for your search. However, it is now not that easy to access Torrentz. And even if they changed their name to Torrentz2, a reliable Torrentz EU proxy is required to access the site.

Torrentz2 is a new torrent search engine that was launched in response to the closure of the original website. The website was created by an anonymous group of developers who took inspiration from the original Torrentz team. Its mission is to give users unrestricted access to all files on the Internet, including movies, games, and music. You can find what you want with this search engine as it indexes millions of torrents from different websites around the world.
